#+TITLE: Automatopia-nodejs
This repo is a web-application template that provides sufficient tooling for
testing at the unit, integration, and end-to-end level.

There is a strong focus on automation and static analysis (linting). Tests can
also be run incrementally to keep the feedback loop as tight as possible.

  Much of the inspiration and implementation is borrowed from James Shore
  (https://github.com/jamesshore). I highly recommend his webseries Let's Code
  Test Driven Javascript (http://www.letscodejavascript.com/).
